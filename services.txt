Services

Our professional repair department specializes in all types of repairs needed to restore old timepieces.

Clock repairs are done on the premises and are fully guaranteed. From minor repairs to intricate major overhauls, all are done with detail and precision. Repairs are done one at a time and treated as though they were our own. It may be an old fashioned way, but to us it’s the only way. Estimates are usually given while you wait, with a full explanation of the repair and restoration to be done. Housecalls are also available for grandfather clocks.

In our up to date fully equipped repair department, we do total restorations and repairs of movements. We like to say “We Repair, we don’t just "FIX". Minor watch repairs and adjustments, battery replacements, bands, buckles and pins can all be done while you wait. Clocks, watches and customer satisfaction is our business, that is what we specialize in……nothing else.

In-Home Clock Repairs
Clocks can be a hassle to move and transport—sometimes they’re too delicate, other times they may be too large to easily move. Our repair services can also be done in your home, giving you the convenience of having the work done on your schedule and with no difficult transportation required.
